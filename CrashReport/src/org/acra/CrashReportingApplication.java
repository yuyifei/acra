/**
 * <p>
 * Base class for any application which need to send crash reports. The final
 * application has to extend this class and at least implement the abstract
 * method {@link #getFormId()} by returning a valid GoogleDocs Form id string
 * generated by importing ACRA's specific spreadsheet template.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you prefer sending crash reports to your own script on your own server,
 * you can override {@link #getFormUri()} and return any Url string to your
 * sever script (like : "http://www.myserver.com/myscript.php").
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If some crash reports could not be sent (due to technical issues like loss of
 * network connection), their data is stored in the application private
 * filesystem and sent on the next <strong>Application</strong> start. This
 * means that the reports might be sent quite some time after the crash, because
 * a crash causes the Activity to be destroyed but not the Application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you would like to receive reports as soon as possible, you may want to
 * call {@link ErrorReporter#checkAndSendReports(android.content.Context)} on
 * {@link ErrorReporter#getInstance()} in your main {@link Activity} onCreate()
 * method.
